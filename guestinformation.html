<h3>Hotel Accommodations</h3>
<p>We have negotiated a group rate on rooms at the Marriott Residence Inn in downtown St. Louis. The hotel is very nice and only a 5 minute drive from the wedding reception site. If you'd rather not drive, there's a shuttle service to and from Lafayette Square that runs until 11 PM.</p>

<p>We've blocked three types of rooms. Two Bedroom Suites, One Bedroom Suites with 2 Queen Beds, and Studio Suites with 1 Queen bed. All have a single soafabed, and a full kitchen.  If you don't feel like cooking and doing dishes, however, the hotel serves a full breakfast every morning. Also, if you book with the group, hotel parking fees for the duration will be waived.</p>

<p>Each type of suite has a different reservation link below. Just click on the suite type you're interested in booking and you will be taken to the hotel's website. On the right hand side, the special group code should be filled in and you can select which dates, the number of rooms, and the number of people you'd like to book for. If you have a Marriott Rewards number, you may enter that as well. After you've selected all of those things, you can click the “Check Availability” button at the bottom of the screen and it will pull up the rates for our group.</p>
