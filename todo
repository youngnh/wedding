Nate and Paige-

First - CONGRATS!! THIS IS SO STINKING EXCITING!

Now to the serious stuff-

Congratulations to both of you. Paige, you are all grown up (always about 10,000 steps ahead of me) Nate, you are one lucky man to have her (you already know this). I can not wait to see the beautiful couple on your wedding day. But until then, if you need any help with anything just let me know. I am just a hop skip and a jump away.

Love you both and congrats

Buck
(ps. I love the website!)
